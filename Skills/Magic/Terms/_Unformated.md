#### Spell Points

A creature is capable of spending a number of Spell Points equal to the average of all their Mental Statistic Scores.

##### Investing Spell Points

When an ability requires that you invest spell points, you must have that number of spell points available, they are not spent, however if you ever lack the required number of spell points the effect ends.

#### Complexity

The complexity of a spell or technique is as it sounds, how hard it is to understand or wrap your head around the very concept. When you use a spell / ability with Complexity, this is the number of Spell Points required to use it.

##### Pump

When a spell component is listed with Pump (n), you can spend n Spell Points spent to add an additional effect. Unless stated, you can apply this effect as many times as you have the Spell Points to spend.

#### Will

The will of a creature is used to bring magic into existence.

A creature’s Will bonus is added to the damage of any spells it casts.

The Check to resist a spell effect is equal to 6 multiplied by the spell’s Tier and then added to the creature’s Will.

#### Mental Domain

The root of all concepts, your spells being no exception, is the astral plane - the plane of thought. When you will a concept into reality you are doing so within your mental domain. Your mental domain is split up into different sectors with sector 0 being your own space.

By default, a creature’s domain only reaches sector 0. It is possible to increase this by increasing ranks in the Esotericism branch. This domain defines how far you are able to cast magic, for each sector boundary that you cross the increase the Spell Point cost by the total number crossed e.g. crossing the first from 0 -> 1 would cost an additional 1, crossing then into the second from 1->2 would cost an additional 2.

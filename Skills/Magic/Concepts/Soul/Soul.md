## Soul

A collection of everything that makes you, you, the soul acts as a driver within the mind while the mind relays the commands to the body. The soul is not usually directly targeted or affected by spells, though those that do come with a negative stigma, considered abhorrent practices. The creation and calling of spirits, while less common is not usually seen in as bad a light.

# Draw Concept

Traits: Affix
Prerequisites: Destroy 1, Esotericism (Any) 
Complexity: 3

Draw a combination of concepts and applicators of Tier 1 that you have access to from an ongoing spell effect within your mental domain. 

This can be used in place of a concept in a spell, any affixed components do not contribute to the spell complexity with respect to the overall cost of the spell, however the total spell complexity of the complete spell cannot exceed your Intelligence Score as normal. 

Make a contested Will check against the one responsible for the effect, if this is environmental then the Will is equal to the lowest required for its Tier. The opposition gains a bonus equal to the complexity you are attempting to draw. 

You can use this against effects you have created without making the check. 

Success: You can use the combination within your spell. 

Failure: The spell fails.

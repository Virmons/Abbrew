# Contract

The skill of forming contracts, whether it be to increase the duration of a manifestation or just hold it until it is used.

# Terms

## Contract: 

Expected short duration, payment for services rendered; there is no limit to the number of Contracts a creature can make.

## Pact: 

Long term, likely a binding between two or more entities; a creature can normally only enter into one Pact at a time.

## Covenant:

A permanent binding between parties extending past the individual e.g. throughout a bloodline or for anyone living within a given area; a creature can normally only have one Covenant at a time.

# Esotericism 

Magics involving the Planes, Astral Travel and the phases of reality.

# Concept Suffusion / Drain

An area suffused with a concept reduces the cost of any spells cast containing that concept by the suffusion; additionally any damage rolls of the concept within that area are strong.

Conversely, an area drained of a concept increases the cost of any spells cast containing that concept by the drain, additionally any damage rolls of the concept within that area are weak.

# Concept Aligned / Opposed

If an area is aligned with a concept, it is conceptually closer to it than elsewhere e.g. A volcano is aligned to fire, the conceptual distance to the plane of fire is lower here.

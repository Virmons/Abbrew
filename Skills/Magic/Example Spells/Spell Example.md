# Example

Taking the example spell below we can break it down and see how a creature would attempt to cast it.
 
(1) Fire Bolt

(2) Range: 0-1

(3) Complexity: 4

(4) Launch a bolt of fire at a target dealing 2d10 fire damage.  

(1) The name of the spell / technique.

(2) These are the sectors within which the spell / technique can be used, here it can be used in sectors 0 and 1.

(3)Â  The complexity of the spell is the total number of spell points required to cast the spell.

(4) Description of what the spell / technique does.  

So for the above spell, given a Tier 1 medium creature had 4(8) Intelligence, 4(8) Visualisation and 4(8) Will, and they have taken a skill to increase their mental domain to having a sector 1 (this would be 8m, 4m each from Visualisation and Will multiplied by their size of 1m). 

The above spell would cost 4 spell points, by using the Visualise ability once they could reduce it by 1 (4 => 10 => 1). They would need to use it a total of 3 times to reduce it by 2 (12 => 20 => 2).  

Given they cast it successfully they would deal 2d10+Will fire damage to their target given they do not manage to dodge or block it.

# Breakdown of the Above Spell

The above spell was shown without this for simplicity, but it is actually made up of several component parts which would be:  

(1) Ward Caster - (2) Manifest - (3) Fire 1 - (4) Project (5)(Sectors 0-1)  

(1) Ward Caster is a common component, used to protect the individual casting the spell. Without this any manifested concept would immediately interact with the first thing they touch i.e. the caster. It is found in the Stop tree.

Complexity 1  

(2) Manifest is another basic component used to bring a concept into existence, here it is linked with Fire 1. It is found in the Creation tree.

Complexity 1  

(3) Fire 1 is a Tier 1 potency flame, it deals 1d10 fire damage to the first thing it touches. It is in the Fire tree.

Complexity 1  

(4) Project is a component that causes a linked concept to move, here linked to Fire 1 it causes the Fire to move towards a target. It is in the Move tree.

Complexity 1  

(5) Sectors 1 is the range of the spell, here it can be cast from sector 0 out to sector 1. Increasing the range at which you can cast spells can be done by spending points in the Esotericism tree.

Cost 5

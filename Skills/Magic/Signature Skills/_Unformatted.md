The materials used as part of a ritual component are consumed in the process, whether directly or becoming otherwise inert and valueless. 

###### Stability 

Each Ritual Component will have a Stability value, once the ritual is complete, roll 1D100 for each component, if you roll below the component's stability, it was a success and nothing unexpected happened. 

If you roll above the component's stability, a rebound occurs, roll on the rebound table starting from the first component that rebounded to the last. 

So long as one component succeeds, the ritual effect takes place, otherwise if all components rebound, the ritual was a failure. 

A roll of 100 always triggers a rebound. 

###### Conditions

Conditions of the ritual may increase or decrease the stability of the ritual. 

###### Rebounds

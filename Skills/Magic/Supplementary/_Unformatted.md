# Supplementary Skills
These abilities allow for more powerful spells to be cast by reducing their spell point cost; they can be used at any time, but using Focus will grant you two actions for supplementary abilities for the cost of one.

# Supplementary

All of the following possess the [Supplementary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vI-IAbJokljZw4UKFW5vd6wz5fVYj52uFDCSoCZacHQ/edit#heading=h.46dlk714bqt4) trait.

#### Incantations

Incantations are spoken words that must be heard to take effect; they lessen the cost of manifesting magic.

##### Incantation (Delay, Limit, [Visualise](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vI-IAbJokljZw4UKFW5vd6wz5fVYj52uFDCSoCZacHQ/edit#heading=h.yhpfirv3x2ga))

You may select this Ability multiple times, up to 10 times for a given Skill and once per Tier e.g. Incantation of Fire 1. 

Each selection of this ability grants the 1st verse of the Incantation, for each incantation there are a number of verses equal to its number e.g. 8th Incantation has 8 verses.

The separate Incantation abilities 1st Incantation through to 10th Incantation as well as each of their verses are used as separate abilities e.g. using Incantation of Fire 2 and speaking both verses would cost 2 actions.

The level of Incantation is connected to the Tier of spells that it will affect e.g. Incantation of Fire 3 only affects Fire spells of Tier 3.

# Pain and Adrenaline

A creature has an Adrenaline score equal to its Constitution Score.

Whenever a creature suffers damage it will suffer pain, reducing its Adrenaline by the value rounded to the next 10 and divided by 10 e.g. if a creature suffers 24 slashing damage, it would reduce its adrenaline by 3 (24->30->3).

When a creature has no Adrenaline, the Pain carries over into the Shocked condition.

A creature regains all Adrenaline following a rest.

#### Creatures Without Adrenaline

Creatures that are not subject to pain or shock have their Blood or Integrity value halved.

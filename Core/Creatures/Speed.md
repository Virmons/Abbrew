# Speed
The Speed score of a creature determines how many actions it can take, most creatures should have Speed 3, granting them 3 actions which is the standard maximum for 1 turn.
Having a higher speed can grant more turns within a round.

## Speed Bonus
This is equal to the creature's Speed Score / 3 rounded up.
This is used to determine Strong/Weak modifiers to reactions between creatures.

## Turns in a Round
A creature has a number of turns in a given round equal to its Speed bonus.
The creature's actions are divided across these turns.

## Speed Example
A creature with Speed 5 would have 2 turns, 1 with 3 actions and another with 2 actions.
The creature would have a Speed Bonus of 2, making their reactions against Speed 1 creatures Strong, and the reactions of Speed 1 creatures Weak when it provokes.

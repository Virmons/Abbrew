# Cover

Cover imposes a penalty on attacks made on creatures protected by it.

## Partial Cover

Partial Cover is gained where something could block incoming attacks but not entirely cover a creature. Any attacks against a creature with Partial Cover are Weak.

Partial Cover is granted by a creature of equal size standing in the way of an attack. 

## Full Cover

Full cover grants the same bonus as Partial Cover, however it also imposes an additional Weak against any rolls targeting specific parts of the creature.

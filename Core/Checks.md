# Checks

Many actions call for a Check to be made in order to determine their success.

A check will specify a type e.g. Strength Check to lift something.

A Check is made by rolling your Tier Dice and adding your Tier and the Statistic Bonus of the check (in the above example Strength Bonus) as well as any additional applicable bonuses.

## Opposed Checks

In the case of an opposed check there will be one creature acting and the other reacting, each must make the required Check and compare their results. In the case of a tie, the creature acting wins.

# Falling

You take 5 Damage for every size you fall past the first.

This is not reduced by armour or tier reduction, only by Constitution.

If you can see the bottom, you can reduce the damage by bending your knees as you land.

If you have space to move at the bottom, you can attempt a Dodge Roll Check, decreasing the damage by the result.

You can reduce the damage by 20 by gaining the Broken(Leg) condition and suffering 2 additional Pain.

Gain the internal condition for any wounds suffered.

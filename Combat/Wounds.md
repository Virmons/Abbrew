# Wounds

When wounds are first suffered they are Active Wounds and pose a present threat to the creature, they can become Healing Wounds which do not directly threaten the creature’s life and over time can be removed.

# Active Wounds

Wounds suffered by a creature cause bleeding equal to their value, at the start of each of their turns a creature reduces its Blood by its Active Wounds.

# Healing Wounds

Healing Wounds can have a value from 1-10.

When Active Wounds become Healing Wounds, round your current Active Wounds to the nearest 10 and divide them by 10 e.g. 33 Healing Wounds would be rounded to 40 and then become 4 Healing Wounds.

When you gain Healing Wounds, only the highest value matters, they do not stack.

Healing Wounds do not cause bleeding at the start of a creature’s turn.

If a creature exerts itself by pushing, they gain Active Wounds equal to the value of their current Healing Wounds e.g. Pushing with 8 Healing Wounds would cause 8 Active Wounds.

The creature suffers a penalty equal to its Healing Wounds on any Constitution-based check.

When a creature rests it reduces its Healing Wounds based on its Constitution, round its Constitution Bonus to the next 10 and divide by 10 e.g. a Constitution Bonus of 18 would heal 2 Healing Wounds on a rest.

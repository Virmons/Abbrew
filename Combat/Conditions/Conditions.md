# Conditions

Conditions can be gained by creatures and may apply bonuses or penalties to them; they are usually accompanied by a value, though if this is not the case and the condition calls for one it can be assumed to be 1.

### Broken

This condition is usually tied to a part of the body, the creature is not able to make use of it and is otherwise treated as though they do not have it. Any attempt to use the part or when taking damage to that part causes the creature to suffer 1 additional Pain.

### Burned

A creature with the Burned condition gains Vulnerability to Fire.

### Chilled

A creature with the Chilled condition gains Vulnerability to Ice.

### Concentrating

Concentrating is gained through the use of an Ability with the Concentration trait, for each use of that ability the Concentrating value increases by 1.

A creature’s Concentrating value only decreases when it completes the Ability it is concentrating on, or if it is not concentrating towards an ability, at the start of its turn.

E.g. A creature with Concentrating 2 is interrupted and fails the Check to continue, it then begins concentrating again, gaining Concentrating 3.

If the creature is interrupted, whether intentionally by taking another action or suffering Pain, it  can attempt a Wits check against its concentrating value multiplied by 5 multiplied by its Tier.

Success: The creature can continue concentrating towards the Ability.

Failure: The creature suffers a Distraction Penalty equal to its Concentrating Value until its next turn.

### Corroded

Any Acid or Physical Damage suffered by the target has Penetrate equal to its Tier multiplied by 5.

### Corruption

Whenever a creature with corruption would gain a lesser Sin, increase that sin to Greater, any identity that the Sin gains is increased by the Corruption value multiplied by 5.

Whenever a creature with corruption would gain a Virtue: Greater Virtues become Lesser Virtues and have their hold reduced by the corruption value multiplied by 5.

Lesser Virtues have their hold reduced by the corruption value multiplied by 10.

### Controlling Grapple

A creature has this condition when it has committed a number of points to a grapple.

Any Dodge attempts made by this creature are Weak.

A creature with this condition can act as its remaining Grapple Score allows.

While Envenomed, a creature cannot remove the Shock Condition.

Envenomed increases the creature’s Shock by 1 at the start of each of its turns.

### Exhaustion

A creature with Exhaustion always has physical and mental fatigue equal to its value; they cannot be reduced below this value until exhaustion is removed.

If this ever reaches 10, the creature falls unconscious and cannot remove that condition until its Exhaustion is below 10.

### Impaled

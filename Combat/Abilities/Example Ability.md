You can change your facing before and after movement without provoking reactions.

Once you stop moving to take another action, your movement finishes.  

(1) The name of the Ability

(2) The action cost, here the cost is 1, so you would have 2 remaining at Tier 1 if you used the Move ability.

(3) This is the frequency at which you can use the ability, this could be Once per Day, Twice per Round, or in this case “Push” which allows you to repeat the action for a price.

(4) This lists the fatigue gained by using the ability and can be either Physical, Mental or None.

(5) This indicates whether or not the action will provoke reactions e.g. if a creature has the Attack of Opportunity Reaction, then they could make an attack against you for moving out of one of their threatened squares.

(6) This is the description of the ability.

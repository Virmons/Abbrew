#### Example

You are represented by the A, facing upwards.

The enemies are represented  by O’s.

If any of those creatures made an attack against you and you contested the attack, they would gain a +15 bonus to do so.  

Likewise, a creature making a ranged attack that you contest would gain the same bonus.

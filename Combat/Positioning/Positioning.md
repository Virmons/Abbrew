# Positioning

The facing of a creature matters when considering melee combatants.

Depending on where they stand, enemies grant each other bonuses to any roll made to attack the threatened creature.

|    |     |    |
|----|-----|----|
| 0  |  0  | 0  |
| +5 |  X  | +5 |
| +5 | +10 | +5 |

Creatures directly in front of you give no bonus.

Creatures to your left or right grant a +5 bonus.

Creatures directly behind you grant a +10 bonus.

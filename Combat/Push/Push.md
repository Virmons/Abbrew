# Push

Push allows you to repeat an action multiple times in one turn, if Push is listed with a value next to it, this is the number of times you can Push each turn e.g. Push 1 would mean you can use the ability once and then push to use it again. ^355210

Each time you Push to use an ability, you suffer the same Fatigue as you will for using the ability (if the ability itself does not cause fatigue, the Push listed will indicate the Fatigue you take); you suffer the fatigue before you take the repeated action.

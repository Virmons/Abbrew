# Bonuses and Penalties

There are various ways to gain Bonuses and Penalties, those from the same source do not stack e.g. two different spells both increasing Constitution would not stack, the larger of the two would take effect, likewise if they were both decreasing Constitution, only the largest penalty would apply.

## Strong / Weak
Strong and Weak are terms used to determine whether a creature should be rolling more dice in a given situation (Strong) or rolling penalty dice to be subtracted from their roll result (Weak).
Strong / Weak stack and counteract eachother.

#### Strong

This bonus means that whenever the creature makes a check of the type, it can roll additional dice. 

When a creature gains Strong, it is usually accompanied by a specific type of roll and a value e.g. Strong(Dexterity) 2, this would mean that the creature would roll 2 more dice on any Dexterity-based check.

Strong counteracts weak and the two cancel eachother out if the values are equal.

### Penalties

#### Weak

This penalty means that whenever the creature makes a check of the type, it must roll a penalty die. 

The result of a Penalty Die is removed from the roll total.

When a creature gains Weak, it is usually accompanied by a specific type of roll e.g. Weak(Dexterity) 2, this would mean that the creature would roll 2 penalty dice on any Dexterity-based check.

Weak counteracts strong and the two can cancel eachother out if the values are equal.

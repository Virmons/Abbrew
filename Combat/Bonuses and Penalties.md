## Bonuses and Penalties

There are various types of Bonus and Penalty, typed Bonuses do not stack with Bonuses of the same type with only the largest applying; though they will stack with Bonuses of other types and all untyped Bonuses stack.

Penalties always stack however, regardless of type.

### Bonuses

#### Strong

This bonus means that whenever the creature makes a check of the type, it can roll additional dice. 

When a creature gains Strong, it is usually accompanied by a specific type of roll and a value e.g. Strong(Dexterity) 2, this would mean that the creature would roll 2 more dice on any Dexterity-based check.

Strong counteracts weak and the two cancel eachother out if the values are equal.

### Penalties

#### Weak

This penalty means that whenever the creature makes a check of the type, it must roll a penalty die. 

The result of a Penalty Die is removed from the roll total.

When a creature gains Weak, it is usually accompanied by a specific type of roll e.g. Weak(Dexterity) 2, this would mean that the creature would roll 2 penalty dice on any Dexterity-based check.

Weak counteracts strong and the two can cancel eachother out if the values are equal.

#### Distraction

Distraction Penalties are caused by situations such as being flanked or upon breaking concentration.

# Critical Hits

Depending on the result a damage roll, you might roll a critical, allowing you to roll again.

The standard critical range is 10, so if you roll a 10, the damage explodes and you can roll another D10; these subsequent D10s can also explode if they are a 10, dealing even more damage.

By increasing the critical range, you decrease the roll you need for it to explode, so increasing it by 1, you would need a 9 or 10 for it to be critical and explode.

The lowest value for the critical range is 5.

Depending on the Damage Type, you can cause additional effects.

# Reactions

Reactions are actions that you can take outside of your turn. These have triggers, this could be generic like the trigger for Attack of Opportunity, which is that a creature uses an ability that provokes reactions within your reach, or more specific as Block which requires you to both be wielding a shield and for a creature to make an attack against you that you are able to perceive.

Creatures are able to take Reactions whether they have taken their turn or not.
